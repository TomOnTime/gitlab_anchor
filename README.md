# markdownutils

Documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/TomOnTime/markdownutils

A few functions I developed while manipulating MarkDown files from
Go.

Contributions always accepted if they include good unit tests.

Bugs gladly accepted, especially if you provide a sample of what
the GitLab and GitHub results should be.  See `main_test.go` for
examples.
